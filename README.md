# ComfyUI-fastblend
fastblend for comfyui, and other nodes that I write for video2video. rebatch image, my openpose

fastblend node：  
1. smoothvideo（逐帧渲染/smooth video use each frames）  
2. interpolateKeyFrame（插帧、只选一部分帧渲染/smooth video only use a portion of the frames）
parameter meaning:
   - accuracy: larger is better, 1 is enough for most situation
   - window_size: how smooth the video.
   - minimum_patch_size: odd number(important), larger is better
   - num_iter: Number of iterations, larger is better
   - Guide weight: a parameter that determines how much motion feature applied to the style video.
   - Batch size: a larger batch size makes the program faster but requires more VRAM.
time complexity(accuracy=1): log(window_size) * minimum_patch_size^2 * num_iter * video length * video resolution

other nodes for making video:  
1. rebatchimage: especially for fastblend，Simultaneously render images (720p, 24G video memory, batch_size can be adjusted to 40), speed up about 40%.  
2. myopenpose: 因为dw_openpose在人物转身的时候不能识别人物后背，但是在人物姿势方面比openpose准确，而openpose可以很好的识别后背，这个就是结合了它两的优点

examples are in example directory.And other nodes don't have much use,so I'm not going to introduce.

Install：download the .zip and unzip to ComfyUI\custom_nodes.

Fastblend main code is from https://github.com/Artiprocher/sd-webui-fastblend
I just made it work in ComfyUI.

March 28, 2024:
New node:
1. alert when finished: just input the full path(...\...\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-fastblend\drop.wav) of a sound, it will play after this node gets images.
2. merge image list: the "Image List to Image Batch" node in my example is too slow, just replace with this faster one.
